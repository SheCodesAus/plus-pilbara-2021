    Why would I sponsor?<br>
    <p>
        Australia is facing a massive skills gap in technology, with 200,000 more workers estimated to be needed in tech by 2025. Modelling finds that increasing diversity in the technology workforce would grow Australia's economy by 1.8 billion each year on average.
        With 75% of the fastest growing jobs requiring technical skills, and only 29% of technical roles held by women, we knew there was a gap in the market to support individuals to both prepare for the future of work, and increase their technical skills to be job-ready. 
        Now more than ever we are seeing the need to double down on the investment in STEM education, by building the pipeline of talent to fill the technical jobs of the future. Since the pandemic in 2020 we are seeing a 30% increase in salaries in tech, and a skills shortage is already evident in many locations around Australia.
        If you’re looking to build technical capability and diversity in your team while building positive brand association, and providing upskilling opportunities to attract and retain staff, discover our She Codes partnership options
