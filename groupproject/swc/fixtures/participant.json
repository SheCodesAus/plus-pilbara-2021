            "bio": "Short bios are concise, biographical paragraphs that professionals use to introduce themselves. You can often find short bios on social media profiles, personal websites and company team directories. Short bios are typically used to provide a summary of an individual's accomplishments, an overview of their career history and a description of their professional goals.\r\n\r\nYour short bio is often the first (and perhaps only) thing a potential employer, client or contact will read before deciding to contact you, so it is important that your bio be accurate, informative and memorable. ItÆs a good idea to include:\r\n\r\nYour name\r\nYour current job title\r\nYour company name or personal brand statement\r\nYour hometown\r\nYour alma mater\r\nYour personal and professional goals\r\nA relevant achievement or accomplishment\r\nYour hobbies\r\nYour skills and areas of expertise\r\nShort bios are brief by definition so it is important to determine which of these topics is most important to make the best impression on your readers.",
